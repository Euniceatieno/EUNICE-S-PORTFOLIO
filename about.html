   <p class="aboutme">ABOUT ME</p>
   <p class="notes">
    I'm Eunice Atieno Ochieng,a 22 year old from  Kenya,born and raised in Nakuru County but 
    educational matters saw me living outside the<br> region from time to time.I am the 3rd born in a beautiful family
    of five-two girls and three boys.Family is one of my core values since they are <br>pretty much my greatest
     motivation.<br>
    <br>EDUCATION<br>
    I finished my primary education in 2012 and immediately joined post primary which goes for four years.
    The last quarter of
    High School<br> period is when it struck me that i actually had interest in science.I found myself thriving more in 
    technical courses such as mathematics and <br> sciences compared to the humanities.That is basically how i
     established 
    that science was my space.So i completed post primary in 2016 and got a chance to join university to pursue a 
    course in Computer Science.The course was meant to <br> last for four years but i was unfortunate to be present for
    only one year.This was due to some financial constraints that arose along the way.While away<br>  from school i used 
    to do 
    odd jobs such as typing<br> and also clerical duties for some friends.This went on for  quite some time until 2020
    when i acquired scholarship to pursue a course in information <br>technology at AkiraChix.That was probably the best
     thing
    had happened to me for the longest.So I am currently a student at AkiraChix taking IT as a course.<br>
    <br>CAREER ASPIRATIONS<br>
    I am passionate about technology and  I am working towards becoming a developer at the end of the year.I am 
    particularly 
    enthusiastic about programming <br> in Python and Javascript.I'm also looking forward to gaining skills in machine
     learning
    and data science.This is in order to fulfil one  of dreams of becoming a data analyst.
    <br>
    <br>INTERESTS<br>
    Aside from technology and all things science,i as well find joy in art-music and craft to be precise.I'd probably
     be in art school if i had a <br> different upbringing.I do enjoy creating stuff like cards and doing diys.Painting 
     is also a skill i have that i would like to grow in.

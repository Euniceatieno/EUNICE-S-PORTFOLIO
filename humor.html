        <p class="content">
            Born a Crime, by Trevor Noah is an autobiographical  comedy book that talks about 
             his life growing up as a black kid  <br>in South Africa during Apartheid.The incidents Noah 
             narrates in the book show how he uses humor to give a .<br>personal insight into the realities of 
             life in South Africa.Noah particularly .<br>He uses humor  as a tool to cope with many negative 
             issues surrounding them..<br>From the book we also note that Noah and his mother connect through humor,
             .<br>which allows them to name and confront their suffering while maintaining a  still .<br>realistic 
             view of their lives as a whole.In no chronology,this blog will highlight instances.<br> of humor in Born
              A Crime and discuss the overall impact of using humor, focusing on how humor enabled .<br>Trevour to 
              make friends and to get out of difficult situations.<br>.<br>

The memoir's first episode shows him, his mother, and his baby brother being endangered not by white men,<br>
 but by Black men who belong to a different tribe. One of the particularly toxic consequences of colonialism and.<br>
 apartheid was the way it led to power struggles between groups who were simultaneously being oppressed by the.<br>
 white ruling elites. Since apartheid ends when Noah is quite a young child, his early life is more impacted by 
 the indirect.<br>
 fallout of violence and power struggles between different Black African groups than direct conflict with white.<br>
 individuals. Noah first explains this reality to readers, and then gives a vivid dramatic episode in which his .<br>
mother throws him out of a moving car. The episode makes a factual reality more vivid and memorable. .<br>
It also shows how Noah and his mother find humor in challenging and dangerous situations. The incident is.<br>
 one in which they could all have been killed; Noah doesn't shy away from admitting that reality, but he also
  doesn't dwell on it..<br>
.<br> <br>
    “My child, you must look on the bright side.”
“What? What are you talking about, ‘the bright side’? Mom, you were shot in the face. <br>
There is no bright side.”“Of course there is. Now you're officially the best-looking<br>
 person in the family.She broke out in a huge smile and started laughing.<br>
  Through my tears, I started laughing, too."<br><br>
 
In the above excerpt Trevor cracks jokes with his mother in the hospital and this<br>
 clearly shows that humor was one of the  major ways they used to get through tough times.<br><br>
 Trevor also uses humor to make friends in school.In grade 8 fitting with white kids was such hussle for him but
  he figured<br> a way to handle this.He was everywhere with everybody at all times.He <br>could be a part of
   any group that was laughing,chit chatting and he’d leave <br>like we wasn’t even present.This was basically 
   how he was able to make allies in school.<br><br>

        <p class="quote">“Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long
           time I wondered why he ever married a <br>woman like my mom in the first place, as she 
           was the opposite of that in every way.<br> If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there 
           were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being <br>raised solely for that purpose. The way
            my mother always explained it, the traditional<br> man wants a woman to be subservient, 
            but he never falls in love with subservient women. <br>He’s attracted to independent women. 
            “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said.<br> “He only wants a woman who is free because 
            his dream is to put her in a cage.”</p>
        <p class="content">

        
        In Trevour Noah’s book-Born A Crime,Abel is Trevor’s abusive stepdad,Andrew’s dad and 
        Patricia’s husband.<br>Abel is a character that is obsessed with “controlling” his wife in 
        order to prove his<br> masculinity in a world that denies him any sense of honor.He was this
         kind<br> of guy who thought going to church was disrespectful.From the book he once says, <br>
         ‘What kind of wife spends the whole day away from her husband? What would<br> people think?I 
         know it’s crazy to think  that there are people bothered by their partners<br> going to church
         .What in this earth is that even?Well,that was Abel for you.<br><br>
        
        Abel’s family is also seen  to be traditional, believing in stereotypical gender roles and 
        expecting women to be<br>  subservient but Patricia hated the customs. She didn’t believe in 
        bowing to<br> men (which was something women literally did) and made a mockery out of bowing 
        <br>when called upon.Patricia’ s resistance to these customs is very evident when Abel<br> takes
         the whole family to his homeland in Tzaneen for christmas. To Abel, <br>bringing home his 
         firstborn son was a monumental event, and Patricia was supposed <br>to play the dutiful woman. 
         But from the book Patricia refuses to perform the<br> customs.Abel felt she was disrespecting 
         him, and they argued the whole time<br> but Patricia gives less if not  zero concern.<br><br>
        
        Abel’s desire to have control over the family contrasts with his complete lack of control 
        over himself (or anything at all) <br>.When he is drunk, which becomes most of the time; he
         seems to have<br> no empathy whatsoever for the family and uses violence to control
          Patricia’s<br> actions.Patricia as always, refuses to live by another persons  rules,<br>
           and so she does not give Abel the chance to control her as he craves.<br>It is clear that 
           Abel attacks Patricia because he is unable to resolve<br> conflicts and i also see it a way 
           of asserting his masculinity.<br><br>
        
        Why then did Abel marry Patricia when she was the exact opposite of the kind of woman he 
        wanted?<br>We realize in our communities and also in Trevor Noah’s Born A Crime, men who are
         pretty much crippled in managing their<br> lives tend to talk about wanting women who are 
         subservient but instead end up marrying independent women<br> who can be able to ‘babysit’ 
         them.In most instances,when these women refuse to be controlled they<br> are termed as 
         disrespectful to their husbands.And this is clearly seen throughout Patricia’s marriage to 
         Abel.<br><br>
